# OpenGLChess

---

`OpenGLBoardGUI/...` is Isaac's portion of the overall project which includes the visuals and OpenGL portion of the Chess Program

`intermezzo/...` and `zwischenzug/...` is Daniel's portion which includes a chess logic and validation backend

**Both *parts* work on their own and the intention is to combine them next semester or over break**

### Notes on `OpenGLBoardGUI/...`:

The files `OpenGLBoardGUI/src/glad.c` and `OpenGLBoardGUI/stb_image.h` should be disregarded for the purpose of grading as they are downloaded and required library files for texture/image loading and OpenGL abstraction. All other files within `OpenGLBoardGUI/` were uniquely created by *Isaac Huffman*.
